"""The policy module is now a risk-tier classifier, not an authorization layer.

Read-only mode, deny rules and the approver gate were all removed: whether a
read or a write is permitted is the agent's decision or the connecting account's
permissions, not the skill's. All that remains is a stateless map from a tool's
declared risk_level to a descriptive tier name carried into the audit row. These
tests pin that it classifies and nothing more — in particular, that it can never
refuse a call.
