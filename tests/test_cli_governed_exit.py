"""The CLI must never report a failed governed write as a success.

Two regressions are pinned here.

**The behaviour** — ``governed()`` aborts non-zero on an error payload and on an
undetermined outcome. Governed twins are wrapped in ``@tool_errors``, which
flattens every exception into ``{"error": ...}`` and *returns* it, so a
command that prints its result unconditionally exits 0 for an operation that
was refused or failed.

**The invariant** — every CLI call into a governed write twin routes its result
through that helper. This is the part that matters over time: the defect was
fixed repo-by-repo several times and kept coming back, because nothing stopped
a *new* command from printing a governed result bare. A structural assertion
does. It was introduced after an audit found the preview path guarded and the
real write path unguarded in 18 of the 24 tools at once — the preview was
stricter than the write it previews.
