"""Shared helpers for XCP-ng AIops ops modules.

Xen Orchestra REST ``/rest/v0`` collection endpoints return a bare JSON array
(of objects when ``fields=`` is passed, of href strings otherwise); a few wrap
results in ``{"data": [...]}``. ``as_list`` normalises all of these to a list
of dicts. All API-returned text reaches the caller only after ``sanitize()``
(output hygiene).
