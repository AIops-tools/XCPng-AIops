"""Output hygiene: strip control/format characters and truncate untrusted text.

Defense-in-depth against *encoding-level* tricks: control characters,
zero-width / bidi format characters, and payload-pushing padding. It does NOT
neutralize natural-language prompt injection — "ignore previous instructions"
passes through unchanged; semantic injection resistance must come from the
consuming agent's own prompt boundaries.

Consolidated from 22 duplicate ``_sanitize()`` implementations across the tool line.
All skills should import from here instead of defining their own copy.

    Removes:
    - C0/C1 control characters (except newline/tab)
    - Unicode Format characters (Cf): zero-width spaces, bidi overrides,
      zero-width joiners — used to smuggle or disguise injected text

    Stripping happens BEFORE truncation so an attacker cannot push the real
    payload past the cut-off by padding with junk control characters.
    ``None`` sanitizes to ``""``.

    A truncated result ends in an ellipsis (U+2026) so the cut is visible. This
    line already treats a silent cut as a defect for lists — a capped page that
    looks complete gets reported as the whole set — and a capped string is the
    same failure at a smaller scale: a shortened error message reads as the
    whole explanation, and its remediation sentence, which comes last, is gone
    without a trace.

    Args:
        text: Untrusted text from xcpng SCALE API responses.
        max_len: Maximum length after truncation. Default 500.

    Returns:

    Companion to :func:`sanitize`, which folds ``None`` into ``""``. That
    conflation is invisible downstream: an empty string reads as "the field
    exists and is empty" when the truth may be "the source never returned this
    field at all". A consumer — and a smaller local model especially — cannot
    recover the difference, and tends to invent one.

    So: absence comes back as ``None`` (JSON ``null``), and only genuinely empty
    values come back as ``""``. Use this for any optional API field; keep
    :func:`sanitize` for values that are always present.

    Args:
        value: Raw value straight from an API response, or None when absent.
