"""Output hygiene: strip control/format characters and truncate untrusted text.

Defense-in-depth against *encoding-level* tricks: control characters,
zero-width / bidi format characters, and payload-pushing padding. It does NOT
neutralize natural-language prompt injection — "ignore previous instructions"
passes through unchanged; semantic injection resistance must come from the
consuming agent's own prompt boundaries.

Consolidated from 22 duplicate ``_sanitize()`` implementations across the tool line.
All skills should import from here instead of defining their own copy.
