"""Read-only mode — a hard switch that removes every write capability.

Set ``XCPNG_READ_ONLY=1`` (or ``true``/``yes``/``on``) and this tool can only
read. Enforcement is deliberately two-layered:

  1. :func:`~xcpng_aiops.governance.decorators.governed_tool` refuses any
     non-``low`` risk call. This covers **every** caller — MCP, the CLI, and
     in-process use — so the switch cannot be sidestepped by changing entry point.
  2. The MCP server *unregisters* write tools, so they never appear in
     ``list_tools()`` at all.

The second layer is what matters for smaller local models. A tool that is absent
cannot be hallucinated into a call; a tool that exists but refuses invites retry
loops and "I'll describe the call instead" behaviour. It is also stronger
evidence for a compliance reviewer: "the write tools are not exposed" beats
"the write tools promise to refuse".

Why an environment variable rather than config: an MCP client launches the
server as a subprocess and can set env directly, with no file to mount or path
to agree on. It is also the form an operator can apply per-invocation.
