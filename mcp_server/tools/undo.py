"""Undo executor — list recorded inverse descriptors and APPLY them.

Every governed write records a replayable inverse descriptor (tool + params) to
``undo.db``. This module closes the loop: ``undo_apply`` looks up a recorded
descriptor and dispatches it to the named governed tool, so the inverse runs on
the SAME governance path as any other call (audited and budget-checked, and — if
the inverse itself is destructive — recorded under its own risk tier). Whether
the inverse *should* run is the caller's decision, exactly as for the original
write; ``undo_apply`` records it either way.

Note: recorded ``undo_params`` are the redacted safe-params captured at record
time, so an inverse that would need a secret value cannot be replayed here — by
design, inverses in this line key off ids/names, not credentials.
