"""MCP server wrapping XCP-ng AIops operations (stdio transport).

Thin adapter layer: each ``@mcp.tool()`` function (in ``mcp_server/tools/``)
delegates to the ``xcpng_aiops`` ops package and is wrapped with the
xcpng-aiops ``@governed_tool`` harness (audit / budget / undo / risk-tier).

Standalone, self-governed XCP-ng operations via Xen Orchestra (preview).
For XCP-ng managed by a Xen Orchestra instance only.

    a tool absent from ``list_tools()`` cannot be hallucinated into a call,
    whereas a tool that exists but refuses invites retry loops. It also gives a
    compliance reviewer something checkable — the write tools are simply not
    exposed.

    ``risk_level == "low"`` is the read/write discriminator; a smoke test
    asserts it stays in agreement with each tool's ``[READ]``/``[WRITE]``
    docstring tag so the two can never drift apart.
