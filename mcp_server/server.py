"""MCP server wrapping XCP-ng AIops operations (stdio transport).

Thin adapter layer: each ``@mcp.tool()`` function (in ``mcp_server/tools/``)
delegates to the ``xcpng_aiops`` ops package and is wrapped with the
xcpng-aiops ``@governed_tool`` harness (audit / budget / undo / risk-tier).

Standalone, self-governed XCP-ng operations via Xen Orchestra (preview).
For XCP-ng managed by a Xen Orchestra instance only.
