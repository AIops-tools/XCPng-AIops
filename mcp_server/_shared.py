"""Shared MCP server primitives: the MCPServer instance, connection helper,
error sanitisation, and the ``@tool_errors`` decorator.

Tool modules under ``mcp_server/tools/`` import ``mcp`` from here and register
their ``@mcp.tool()`` functions onto it. ``mcp_server/server.py`` then imports
those modules and runs the server.

Keep ``Optional[X]`` (never PEP 604 ``X | None``) in any reflected tool
signature. mcp>=2.0 accepts the union, but the legacy form is retained for
consistency and to stay safe under any pydantic reflection path (踩坑 #33 —
older mcp/pydantic eval'd the union to ``types.UnionType`` and crashed the
``issubclass`` check).
